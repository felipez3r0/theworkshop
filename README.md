# Licenses and Standards
A free license or open license is a license agreement which contains conditions permitted to the user from the holder on a specific list of uses for his work, which gives him four major freedoms.
Without a special license, these uses are normally prohibited by the laws of copyright. 

For content we can use licenses like Creative Commons
https://creativecommons.org/choose/?lang=en

# How we can work together and share content?
We can use a lot of platforms to work together like Github, Google Docs, and etc.

When we are using those platforms, we need to add an open license to guarantee that our content will be accessible to reuse and to remix!

# Activity  

## Sharing Content 
### Scenarios: Which license would you use?  
  - You created music that you are happy for others to remix. You would like for those remixing your work to give you credit. 
  - You collected data in a graph that you shared with the general public and you would like anyone remixing it to share their corrections with you. 
  - You published a collection of photos that you don't want anyone to use. 
  
## Using Content
### Scenarios: Consequences 
 - You use a photo published under copyright in a school paper
 - You use a graph published under copyright in a published article on a blog with ads
 - You remix someone's code published under CC without recognition.
